    "The relationship between having kids, marital status, income level and the loan purpose with the timely repaying a loan were considered by the corresponding categories for these features. For different groups it could be noticed differences in the debt default rate. It seems that  there is some connection between considered feature and repaying a loan on time. Although for most income levels, the rate is practically the same and only for customers with very high income is a litle bit lower. Found interesting differences in groups when the group is divided by 2 features at the same time. But it is necessary to look at the statistical significance of all revealed differences."

    "* employees have a relatively high default-rate for a car or education\n",
