### Forecasting the Volume of Reserves in Oil Wells

The assignment is to find the best region for new wells for the mining company.

There are data on oil samples from three regions with the parameters of each oil well in the region.

__The purpose of the study__: to build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells in order to pick the oil wells with the highest estimated volume and choose the region with the highest expected profit margin and acceptable risk of losses.

__Data description__

Geological exploration data for the three regions are stored in files:
* `geo_data_0.csv`
* `geo_data_1.csv`
* `geo_data_2.csv`

Each dataset has the following structure: 
* `id` — unique oil well identifier
* `f0`, `f1`, `f2` — three features of points (their specific meaning is unimportant,
but the features themselves are significant)
* `product` — volume of reserves in the oil well (thousand barrels).
