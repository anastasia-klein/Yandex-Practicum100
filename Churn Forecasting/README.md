### Customer Churn Forecasting

The assignment is to carry out the customer churn analysis for the gym chain and develope a customer interaction strategy based on it.

Data on churn for a given month, customers profiles and some information on their behavior on the month preceding it is available.

__The purposes of the study are to__:

* predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer
* analyze the factors that impact churn most
* draw up groups of user portraits and determine their main features
* develop a customer retention strategy and identify target groups

__Description of the data__

The dataset includes the following fields:

* `Churn` — the fact of churn for the month in question
gender
* `Near_Location` — whether the user lives or works in the neighborhood where the gym is located
* `Partner` — whether the user is an employee of a partner company (the gym has partner companies whose employees get discounts; in those cases the gym stores information on customers' employers)
* `Promo_friends` — whether the user originally signed up through a "bring a friend" offer (they used a friend's promo code when paying for their first membership)
* `Phone` — whether the user provided their phone number
* `Age`
* `Lifetime` — the time (in months) since the customer first came to the gym
* `Contract_period` — 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year
* `Month_to_end_contract` — the months remaining until the contract expires
* `Group_visits` — whether the user takes part in group sessions
* `Avg_class_frequency_total` — average frequency of visits per week over the customer's lifetime
* `Avg_class_frequency_current_month` — average frequency of visits per week over the preceding month
* `Avg_additional_charges_total` — the total amount of money spent on other gym services: cafe, athletic goods, cosmetics, massages, etc.
